# Archive - App.tsx Development Iterations

This folder contains various iterations of the App.tsx component that were created during development. They are archived here for reference but are not actively used.

## Files Explanation:

- **`App-backup.tsx`** - Backup version from early development
- **`App-clean.tsx`** - Attempt at cleaning up the main component
- **`App-fixed.tsx`** - Version with specific bug fixes applied
- **`App-robust.tsx`** - More robust implementation attempt
- **`App-simple.tsx`** - Minimal/simplified version for testing
- **`App-test.tsx`** - Testing-focused version
- **`App-working.tsx`** - Known working version (backup)

## Current Active File:

- **`../App.tsx`** - The main, current, and active App component

## Cleanup Notes:

- These files were moved here on August 16, 2025
- They can be safely deleted if no longer needed
- They are kept for reference in case rollback is needed
- The main `App.tsx` is the only file actively used by the application

## Development Best Practices:

Instead of creating multiple App.tsx variants, consider:

1. Using Git branches for different features
2. Using Git tags for working versions
3. Using feature flags for testing different implementations
4. Creating separate components for different features
